Postgres with Rust
---

Learning a new language is depressing.

  * Your productivity shoots way down
  * Simple things become impossible
  * You don't have any of your old libraries to work with
  * All your cool tricks don't work
  * You realize you only know how to interact with the outside
    world through wrappers and DSL's (rubyist here)

So I need a friend.
and what better friend than Postgres!

first I am going to go through this blog
http://siciarz.net/24-days-of-rust-postgres/

and then see what else I can come up with.
maybe even create some new features for fizzbuzz-as-a-service
